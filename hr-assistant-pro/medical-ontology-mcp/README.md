# Medical Ontology MCP Server

An open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for working with medical ontologies including SNOMED CT, ICD-10, RxNorm, and LOINC. Designed for academic researchers who need flexible, reproducible access to medical terminology services.

## Features

- üè• Support for major medical ontologies (SNOMED CT, ICD-10, RxNorm, LOINC)
- üîç Full-text search across all ontologies
- üîó Cross-ontology mapping and relationships
- ‚ö° High-performance preprocessing for 20x faster loading
- üîç Automatic format detection (XML, CSV, RRF formats)
- üöÄ Easy setup with Docker or Python
- üìä Research-friendly with batch processing support
- üîí Data privacy - bring your own ontology files
- üìñ Full API documentation and examples
- üéì Academic citation support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Data Acquisition Required

**This repository does NOT include medical ontology data files.** You must obtain them separately from official sources due to licensing restrictions.

üìñ **[Start Here: Data Acquisition Guide](DATA_ACQUISITION.md)** - Step-by-step instructions to obtain:
- SNOMED CT from NLM (free US license)
- ICD-10-CM from CMS (public domain)
- RxNorm from NLM (free license)
- LOINC from Regenstrief (free registration)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ or Docker
- Medical ontology data files (see [Data Acquisition Guide](DATA_ACQUISITION.md))

### Option 1: NPX Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally via NPX
npx medical-ontology-mcp setup

# Or install locally for a project
npm install medical-ontology-mcp
npx medical-ontology-mcp setup
```

### Option 2: Python Package Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install medical-ontology-mcp

# Set up data (see Data Acquisition Guide)
python -m medical_ontology_mcp.setup.preprocess_all --data-path ./data

# Start server
python -m medical_ontology_mcp.server
```

### Option 3: Docker Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajor2000/mcp_medicalterminology.git
cd medical-ontology-mcp
docker-compose up -d
```

## Configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "medical-ontology": {
    "command": "python",
    "args": ["/path/to/medical-ontology-mcp/src/server.py"]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Search

```python
from medical_mcp_client import MedicalOntologyClient

client = MedicalOntologyClient("http://localhost:8080")

# Search for a condition
results = await client.search("diabetes mellitus", ontologies=["SNOMED", "ICD10"])

# Get concept details
concept = await client.get_concept("SNOMED", "73211009")
```

### Research Workflow

See [examples/research_workflow.ipynb](examples/research_workflow.ipynb) for a complete research example including:
- Batch processing clinical notes
- Mapping free text to standard codes
- Exporting results for statistical analysis

## Data Sources

This framework requires medical ontology data files which must be obtained separately due to licensing requirements. See [DATA_SOURCES.md](docs/DATA_SOURCES.md) for detailed instructions on obtaining:

- SNOMED CT from NLM UMLS
- ICD-10 from WHO or CMS
- RxNorm from NLM
- LOINC from Regenstrief Institute
