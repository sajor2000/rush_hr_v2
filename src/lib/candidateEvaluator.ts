CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- EXTRACT THE CANDIDATE'S FULL NAME from the resume (usually at the top)
- If no name found, use "Name Not Found" but NEVER leave blank
- CREATE SCORE DISTRIBUTION: Use the full scoring range to differentiate candidates
- Avoid clustering scores - spread them across the range for better quartile distribution

EVALUATION PROCESS:

1. MUST-HAVE GATE: Check ALL must-have qualifications. Note missing items but continue scoring`;

  // Job type specific prompts
  if (jobType === 'entry-level') {
    return basePrompt + `

2. DETAILED SCORING FOR ENTRY-LEVEL POSITIONS (if must-haves met):
   a) Soft Skills & Availability (35%): Reliability, communication, teamwork, schedule flexibility, customer service orientation
   b) Basic Qualifications & Potential (25%): Meets minimum requirements, shows growth potential, trainability indicators
   c) Experience Relevance (20%): ANY relevant experience including part-time, volunteer, internships, school projects
   d) Education & Training (15%): Relevant education, certifications, training programs, continuous learning
   e) Resume Quality (5%): Basic clarity and organization (be lenient - entry-level may have simple resumes)

3. ENTRY-LEVEL SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:
   - Consider ALL experience types: volunteer work, internships, part-time jobs, school projects
   - Look for transferable skills from unrelated fields
   - Value attitude and potential over extensive experience
   - Check for basic computer skills and willingness to learn
   - Consider availability for required shifts/schedules
   - Don't penalize short work history or limited professional experience

4. SCORING DISTRIBUTION FOR ENTRY-LEVEL (20-95 range):
   - Exceptional (85-95): Outstanding potential, exceeds all expectations
   - Strong (70-84): Very good fit, ready to excel with training
   - Good (55-69): Solid candidate, meets core requirements
   - Fair (40-54): Has potential but needs development
   - Weak (20-39): Significant gaps but could be considered

IMPORTANT: Differentiate scores! If evaluating multiple candidates:
- Best candidate: 85-95
- Second tier: 70-84
- Middle tier: 55-69
- Lower tier: 40-54
- Weakest: 20-39
