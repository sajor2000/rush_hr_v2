# Rush University HR Assistant - Environment Configuration
# ========================================================

# OpenAI API Configuration (REQUIRED)
# -----------------------------------
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 
# IMPORTANT: Your API key must have access to these models:
# - gpt-4o (latest model for resume evaluation and requirement extraction)
# - gpt-4o-mini (efficient model for job type detection and chat intent)
#
# Usage estimates for 40 resumes:
# - Approximately 200,000-300,000 tokens total
# - Cost: ~$2-4 depending on resume length
#
# Make sure your OpenAI account has:
# 1. Sufficient credits or valid payment method
# 2. Access to GPT-4 models (may require API tier upgrade)
# 3. Rate limits that support 50+ requests per minute

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Example format (DO NOT commit real keys):
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Note: In production (Vercel), add this as an environment variable
# in your project settings, NOT in your code repository.

# CORS Configuration (Optional)
# =============================
# Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS
# Leave empty or set to "*" to allow all origins (not recommended for production)
# Example: ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://example.com,https://app.example.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=

# Security Note: In production, always specify exact allowed origins
# instead of using wildcard (*) to prevent unauthorized access

# Resume Processing Configuration (Optional)
# ==========================================
# Skip resume preprocessing for testing (true/false)
# When set to true, resumes are sent to AI without any preprocessing
# Useful for debugging parsing issues or when preprocessing causes problems
# Default: false (preprocessing enabled for resumes over 8000 tokens)
SKIP_RESUME_PREPROCESSING=false
