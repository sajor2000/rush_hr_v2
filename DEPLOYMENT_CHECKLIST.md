   - Fixed field name inconsistencies (mustHavesMet, professionalism, explanation)

2. **Production Readiness**
   - âœ… All debug console.logs wrapped in NODE_ENV checks
   - âœ… Test endpoints removed
   - âœ… No hardcoded secrets or API keys
   - âœ… Build passes without errors
   - âœ… TypeScript compilation successful

### Environment Variables Required
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Key Features Working
- âœ… Resume evaluation with AI scoring
- âœ… Batch resume processing
- âœ… Quartile ranking for qualified candidates
- âœ… Chat functionality with context-aware responses
- âœ… PDF and DOCX file support
- âœ… CSV and PDF export capabilities

### Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your deployment platform (Vercel, etc.)
   - Ensure the API key has access to `gpt-4o` and `gpt-4o-mini` models

2. **Deploy to Development**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix chat functionality and prepare for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Test resume upload and evaluation
   - Verify chat responses are working
   - Check that resume text is available in chat context
   - Test CSV and PDF export functionality

### Important Notes
- The application uses streaming responses for better UX
- Rate limiting is implemented (10 requests per minute per IP)
- Chat is stateless - no conversation history is stored
- All evaluation results are cached in-memory during the session

### Known Limitations
- Chat doesn't persist conversation history between sessions
- Basic text search for evidence (could be improved with semantic search)
- In-memory cache is cleared on server restart

The application is ready for deployment! ðŸš€
