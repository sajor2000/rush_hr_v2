# Document Processing Optimization Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Document Processing Issues

### 1. **Reduced Concurrent Parsing Limit**
- Changed from `pLimit(15)` to `pLimit(3)`
- This prevents memory overload when processing multiple PDFs simultaneously

### 2. **Implemented Batch Processing**
- Added `BATCH_SIZE = 5` to process resumes in smaller chunks
- Processes 5 files at a time instead of all files at once
- Adds 500ms delay between batches to prevent system overload

### 3. **Added Timeout Protection**
- Added 30-second timeout for each file parsing operation
- Prevents hanging on problematic PDFs
- Uses `Promise.race()` to ensure parsing doesn't block indefinitely

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**
- Added detailed logging for PDF parsing (item count, duration, buffer size)
- Better error messages with context
- Progress tracking now reports batch numbers

### 5. **Improved Progress Reporting**
- Now shows "Processing batch X of Y" messages
- Real-time progress updates after each file
- More accurate percentage calculations

## Performance Improvements

The optimizations should result in:
- More stable processing of large batches (40+ resumes)
- Better memory management
- Clearer progress indication
- Graceful handling of problematic PDFs
- Reduced chance of timeouts or crashes

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with a mix of PDF and DOCX files
2. Include some large PDFs (>5MB) to test timeout handling
3. Monitor console logs for batch processing messages
4. Verify that progress updates correctly
5. Check that problematic files don't block the entire process

## Additional Notes

- The chat functionality remains unchanged and should continue working
- CORS headers are properly configured for both APIs
- The evaluation cache helps with duplicate files
- Token optimization is still applied to reduce API costs
